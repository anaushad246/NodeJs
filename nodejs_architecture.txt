Node.js architecture is built for efficiency in handling a high volume of concurrent connections. Here are the key aspects to understand:
Single-threaded Event Loop:
Unlike traditional web servers that use multiple threads, Node.js employs a single-threaded event loop. This means it processes tasks one at a time.
Non-Blocking I/O:
The magic lies in non-blocking I/O operations. When a request arrives, Node.js doesn't wait for slow I/O tasks (like disk access or network calls) to complete.
It places them in a queue and moves on to handle other requests.
Event Queue and Callbacks:
The event queue holds pending I/O tasks.
Once an I/O operation finishes, an event is triggered, and a callback function associated with that task is added to another queue.
The event loop then picks up these callback functions from the queue and executes them, effectively completing the requests.
Modules:
Use Cases of Node.js:
Real-time applications: Chat applications, social media feeds, collaborative editing tools.
I/O bound tasks: Data streaming, APIs, microservices.
Single-page applications (SPAs): Backend for SPAs built with frameworks like React or Angular.
